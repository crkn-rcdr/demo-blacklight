/** Code to "flatten" quadratic and cubic Bézier curves to polylines.
 *
 * All code in this module is based on JavaScript code by Raph Levien, published on his blog at
 * https://raphlinus.github.io/.
 * I merely changed the structure a bit, removed some unneeded parts and added some comments and type hints.
 *
 * Flattening of quadratic Bézier curves:
 * - Article: https://raphlinus.github.io/graphics/curves/2019/12/23/flatten-quadbez.html
 * - Code: https://github.com/raphlinus/raphlinus.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2019-12-23-flatten-quadbez.md?plain=1#L73-L212
 *
 * Flattening of cubic Bézier curves: https://levien.com/tmp/flatten.html
 *
 * Note that the code in this module has a different license than the rest of the package,
 * due to the inclusion of Apache-licensed third party code.
